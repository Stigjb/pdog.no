#### I'm already stoked, what is the Special Event?

That's a secret and will be revealed during the event.

#### Who's hosting this amazing event?

You might know him as "Nordkalottens SÃ¸nn" on GeoGuessr. He's the geo community's ring master:
Petter "Dog" Holstad and crew.

#### I'm all in - where is it?

Due to the current global health event, this Special Event is held in the cyberspace.
More specifically, it will be hosted on our Discord channel.

#### Sounds really exclusive - who's invited?

Anyone in the Got Geo? chat with previous guesser experience.

#### Okay - final very frequently asked question, WHEN?

Due to our shifting time tables, that's up to you. I've created a Doodle to schedule it
a time before May is over. Page will be updated when the time is decided.
